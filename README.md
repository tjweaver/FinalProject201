Readme
Our project at its current state is divided into the front and back end parts working but not connected yet. In order to run the code you must unzip the entire music library and run the SongAnalyzer.analyze() method on the entire library in order to populate the database of the MFC coefficients. The runtime of this function on the whole library which is necessary will take approximately 2 hours but after that it will never need to be run again. Song analysis is very time consuming and complex so this 2 hours is not surprising. Then also please run the Playlist builder method to build all the necessary playlists and populate the Look up table. 
	The front end app works well and the backend song analysis works. the last thing needed is to connect these two portions over a server like heroku and have a full functioning app.
